                <ul>
                    <li>House wash - we wash the exterior of your house using a fancy technique called "softwash." We use chemicals and low pressure to remove the mildew and grime from vinyl, brick, or stucco siding. Your house is important to you, so it's important to us. That's why we keep learning new techniques to keep your property safe.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Drive way / walkway cleaning - Using chemical and a big, expensive tool called a "surface cleaner" we do exactly what the name suggests -- we clean the surface of the concrete. The chemical breaks down the grime and the surface cleaner takes it right off, and a final rinse leaves the concrete looking fresh and new.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Retaining walls - Pretty much the same process as a house wash.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Pavers - Beginning process is the same as a driveway / walk way cleaning. The difference is that we don't use the surface cleaner, but instead we work chemical in with a broom and then use a lower pressure stream to rinse the pavers. Maybe you're thinking, "Lena, Taylor. That has to take a lot longer!" And you'd be right, but we care about your property and don't want to blow the sand out from the pavers, so we take a bit longer to ensure a nice clean without causing YOU more work. You're welcome ;)</li>
